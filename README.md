## NeuronalNetworkTest

Just some random tests with neural networks in Python 3 to learn how it work

Oh and I made a **n sized '2048' game** in Python 3 (the purpose is that the neural network will have to learn to play this game)

The game can be found in the 2048_game folder.

> If you want to play it as an human you probably want to launch it like
> ```
> 2048_game/2048.py -c -sc -cs
> ``` 

For more informations about the game, read the associated README.
